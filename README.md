# weather_forecast
Created by @khanthmu

Python mini Flask app for forecasting current weather situation.
You can search by city name and add to your preference list if you love.
Used Bootstrap framework and a little Javascript for UI, Python- Flask micro framework for backend and SQlite for database.

Enjoy it!
